My NCAA March Madness App that fills out your bracket based on interests you have.

Currently hosted at: http://bracket.heroku.com/.  Very early still, just posting for testing...feedback welcomed.

Sign Up -> Fill out Name and Favorite Team -> Fill out questions -> Buid Bracket -> View Bracket

Decided to do as learning/fun for myself.  Not sure if it will go to real production yet...
